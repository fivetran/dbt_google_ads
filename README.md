# Google Ads Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_google_ads/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Google Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Google Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source).
- Enables you to better understand the performance of your ads across varying grains:
  - Providing an account, campaign, ad group, keyword, ad, and utm level reports.
- Materializes output models designed to work simultaneously with our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Google Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_google_ads/).

<!--section="google_ads_transformation_model-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_google_ads/#!/overview?g_v=1&g_e=seeds).

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?

## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Google Ads connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils`.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following google_ads package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/google_ads
    version: [">=0.10.0", "<0.11.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```
Do **NOT** include the `google_ads_source` package in this file. The transformation package itself has a dependency on it and will install the source package as well.

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `google_ads` schema. If this is not where your Google Ads data is (for example, if your Google Ads schema is named `google_ads_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    google_ads_database: your_destination_name
    google_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations

### Union multiple connectors
If you have multiple google_ads connectors in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either the `google_ads_union_schemas` OR `google_ads_union_databases` variables (cannot do both) in your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    google_ads_union_schemas: ['google_ads_usa','google_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    google_ads_union_databases: ['google_ads_usa','google_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```
Please be aware that the native `source.yml` connection set up in the package will not function when the union schema/database feature is utilized. Although the data will be correctly combined, you will not observe the sources linked to the package models in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This happens because the package includes only one defined `source.yml`.

To connect your multiple schema/database sources to the package models, follow the steps outlined in the [Union Data Defined Sources Configuration](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest#union_data-source) section of the Fivetran Utils documentation for the union_data macro. This will ensure a proper configuration and correct visualization of connections in the DAG.

### Adding passthrough metrics
By default, this package will select `clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost` from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the below configurations to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) if desired, but not required. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

>**Note** Please ensure you exercised due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default (taps, impressions, and spend) have been vetted by the Fivetran team maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, for example metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You will want to ensure whichever metrics you pass through are indeed appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels provided in this package.

```yml
vars:
    google_ads__account_stats_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field"
    google_ads__campaign_stats_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "this_field"
    google_ads__ad_group_stats_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
    google_ads__keyword_stats_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "that_field"
    google_ads__ad_stats_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "other_id"
        alias: "another_id"
```
### Enable UTM Auto Tagging
This package assumes you are manually adding UTM tags to your ads. If you are leveraging the auto-tag feature within Google Ads then you will want to enable the `google_auto_tagging_enabled` variable to correctly populate the UTM fields within the `google_ads__utm_report` model.
```yml
vars:
    google_auto_tagging_enabled: true # False by default
```

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Google Ads staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_google_ads_source`) and your Google Ads modeling models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_google_ads`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Google Ads data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    google_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    google_ads:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    google_ads_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
