# dbt_google_ads v0.10.1
[PR #62](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/62) includes the following updates: 

## Bug Fixes 
- This package now leverages the new `google_ads_extract_url_parameter()` (located within the dbt_google_ads_source package) macro for use in parsing out url parameters. This was added to create special logic for Databricks instances not supported by `dbt_utils.get_url_parameter()`.
  - This macro will be replaced with the `fivetran_utils.extract_url_parameter()` macro in the next breaking change of this package.

## Under the Hood 
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# dbt_google_ads v0.10.0
[PR #52](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/52) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple google_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the Hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro. 
    - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column. 

[PR #60](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/60) includes the following update:
## Dependency Updates
- Removes the dependency on `dbt-expectations`. Upstream we specifically removed the `dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_match_regex_list` test.
## Under the Hood 
- Updates the [DECISIONLOG](DECISIONLOG.md) to clarify why there exist differences among aggregations across different grains. 

# dbt_google_ads v0.9.3
[PR #57](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/57) includes the following updates:
## Bug fixes
- Updated end models to select key columns from the `stats` source instead of the `reports` source to avoid introducing null values.

    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `packages.yml` has been updated to reflect new default `fivetran/fivetran_utils` version, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

## ðŸŽ‰ Features ðŸŽ‰
- For use in the [dbt_ad_reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting), users can now allow records having nulls in url fields to be included in the `ad_reporting__url_report` model. See the [dbt_ad_reporting README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting) for more details ([#39](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/39)). 
## ðŸš˜ Under the Hood ðŸš˜
- Disabled the `not_null` test for `google_ads__url_report` when null urls are allowed ([#39](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/39)).

# dbt_google_ads v0.8.1

## Updates:
- Updates `google_ads__ad_report` model to get `ad_id` from `ad_stats` table rather than from `ads_history`. ([#37](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/37))

# dbt_google_ads v0.8.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The `adwords` api version of the package has been fully removed. As the Fivetran Google Ads connector now requires the Google Ads API, this functionality is no longer used. ([#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/34))
- Removal of the `google_ads__ad_adapter` model. ([#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/34))
- Major updates have also been applied to the [dbt_google_ads_source](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source) package which is a dependency of this package. Please refer to the [v0.8.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source/releases/tag/v0.8.0) release notes for more details before upgrading your package.
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed. To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough metrics in the following format:
> This applies to all passthrough metrics within the `dbt_google_ads` package and not just the `google_ads__ad_stats_passthrough_metrics` example.
```yml
vars:
  google_ads__ad_stats_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Enhancements ðŸŽ‰
- Addition of the following new end models. These models were added to provide further flexibility and ensure greater accuracy of your Google Ads reporting. Additionally, these new end models will be leveraged in the respective downstream [dbt_ad_reporting](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting) models.
  - `google_ads__account_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the account level.
  - `google_ads__campaign_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance of a campaign at the campaign/advertising_channel/advertising_channel_subtype level.
  - `google_ads__ad_group_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the ad group level.
  - `google_ads__keyword_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the ad group level for keywords.
  - `google_ads__ad_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance at the ad level.
  - `google_ads__url_report`
    - Each record in this table represents the daily performance of URLs at the ad level.

- Added testing for each end model to ensure granularity and accuracy of the modeled data. ([#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/34))
- README updates for easier navigation and use of the package. ([#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/34))
- Inclusion of additional passthrough metrics within the respective end state models detailed above: ([#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/34))
  - `google_ads__ad_group_stats_passthrough_metrics`
  - `google_ads__campaign_stats_passthrough_metrics`
  - `google_ads__keyword_stats_passthrough_metrics`
  - `google_ads__account_stats_passthrough_metrics`

# dbt_google_ads v0.7.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The `api_source` variable is now defaulted to `google_ads` as opposed to `adwords`. The Adwords API has since been deprecated by Google and is now no longer the standard API for the Google Ads connector. Please ensure you are using a Google Ads API version of the Fivetran connector before upgrading this package. ([#32](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/pull/32))
  - Please note, the `adwords` version of this package will be fully removed from the package in August of 2022. This means, models under `models/adwords_connector` will be removed in favor of `models/google_ads_connector` models.
# dbt_google_ads v0.6.1
- Updated google_ads__url_ad_adapter link in README (Thank you to @bkimjin! ([#26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/issues/26)))
# dbt_google_ads v0.6.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The `account` source table has been renamed to be `account_history`. This has been reflected in the source model references within this release. ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source/pull/24))
- The `ad_final_url_history` model has been removed from the connector. The url fields are now references within the `final_urls` field within the `ad_history` table. These changes are reflected in the `google_ads__url_adapter` model. ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source/pull/24))
# dbt_google_ads v0.5.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_google_ads_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_google_ads_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_google_ads v0.1.0 -> v0.4.0
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
